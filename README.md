# Reviiot (Cards Game)
This project is an implementation of the cards game "Reviiot" (Quartets). The main concept of this project was practicing memory management  and coding in C++.

This project was an assignment in the academic course "System Programming Languages" (SPL) as part of my Computer Science B.Sc studies at Ben Gurion University of The Negev, Israel. I worked on this project with another coleague to this course.
